00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
Look

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.300
Now, it's like this, little britches.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.800
All you gotta do is - (clap)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Look for the bare necessities

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
The simple bare necessities,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Forget about your worries and your strife.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.000
(Clap)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500
I mean the, bare necessities

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Are Mother Nature's recipies

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That bring the bare necessities of life.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Wherever I wonder, wherever I roam.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
The bees are buzzing in the tree
To make some honey just for me.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Then maybe, try a few.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You eat ants?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Ha-ha, you better believe it!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
And you're gonna love the way they tickle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Mowgli, look out!

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
The bare necessities of life 
will come to you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But when?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They'll come to you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Look for the bare necessities

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The simple bare necessities.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Forget about your worries and your strife.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I mean the bare necessities,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's why a bear can rest as ease

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
With just the bare necessities of life.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now when you pick a paw-paw,
Or a prickly pear.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.500
Ow!

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500
And you prick a raw paw,
Well, next time beware.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw,
When you pick a pear try to use the claw.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.000
But you don't need to use the claw,
When you pick a pair of the big paw-paw.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Have I given you a clue?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.500
Golly, thanks Baloo!

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Paw-paw, ha! Of all the silly gibberish.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They'll come to me!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They'll come to you!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
How 'bout scratchin' that old left shoulder while you're up there,
Mowgli?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now just a hair lower.. There, right there.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.000
That's it. Ahh..
This is beautiful.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.500
That's good. Kid, we've got to get to a tree, 
this calls for some big scratch!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500
You're lots of fun, Baloo!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Right on it.. Yeah! 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.500
That's delicious! Oh, ooo! Just a little bit--


00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
mmm.. yeah.. ha-ha.. ooo.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.500
Mm... mmm... ha-ha.. ooo. yeah!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Oh man, this is really livin'.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So just try and relax. Yeah.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Cool it. Fall apart in my back yard. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Cause let me tell you something
little britches.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If you act like that bee acts, uh-uh. You're working
too hard.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And don't spend your time looking around for something
you want, that can't be found.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
(Clap, clap) When you find out you can live without it
and go along not thinking about it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.500
And I'll tell you something true.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The bare necessities of life will come to you.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
Ahh.. I give up. Well, I hope his luck holds out. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.000
Mowgli, how 'bout you singing?
Look for the bare necessities,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The simple bare necessities.
Forget about your worries and your strife.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Yeah, man!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I mean the bare necessities,
that's why a bear can rest at ease.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.500
With just the bare necessities of life.
Yeah!

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.500
With just the bare necessities of life,
yeah, man!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Ha-ha-ha. Beautiful. 
That's real jungle harmony.
