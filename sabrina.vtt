00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
I thought she was a specialist.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
She is, a specialist in hair-dressing.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
She thinks you have a follicle problem.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I think my brain might be sweating.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Ah..

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Are we in the neighbourhood?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
No, it's horrible!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Oh, well listen, don't worry.
It can be fixed!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Listen, I'm gonna need a bucket of ice, 
some antiseptic ointment,
and I need Sabrina to sign a release form. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.000
And, uh, why don't up the stereo?
It helps drown out the scream.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Stop, I can fix it myself!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
Would restraints help?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
It was a spell!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I was just trying to get you guys back together
because I don't like us not being a family anymore. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You did what?!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Look, if I was sick, could I do this?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Laughing)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Okay, so I'm no Ken Berry.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Sabrina, we have a confession to make. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We didn't really split up.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Okay, and you live in two different houses because...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We pretended to split up. 
To help you learn that we're better parents as a unit.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.500
You shouldn't pit us against one another.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Okay, and you couldn't tell me this before because...

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.500
We did. And you responded by sneaking off to the science club party.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Okay and I have no response to that because...

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.000
You know we're right.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Why did the cat have to suffer? Aw...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.500
Wait, this couldn't have been a ruse.
I mean, I was called before the witches' council.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.500
And we were happy to help.
It's been a slow month and... 
I've got teenagers at home.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.000
Talk about your full service organization.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.500
And now if you'll excuse me, 
I've gotta go deal with a little boy who won't wash behind his ears.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
This time I get to be a matador.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Well, I certainly learned my lesson.
